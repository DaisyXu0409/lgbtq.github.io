    <h1>LGBTQ+ Justice</h1>

    <p>
      Everyday around the world, the LGBTQ+ Community are being discriminated against for being who they are. In 70 countries, being  LGBTQ+ is illegal, 
      and in 12 you could be given the death penalty. LGBTQ+ youths are often having more risks for experiences in violence and more suicidal compared to cisgender heterosexual youths. 
      Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has declassified both Homosexuality, 30 years ago on May 17th, 
      and Gender Nonconformity on May 25th, 2019 as mental disorders, many people, in todayâ€™s society, still have wrongful and ignorant stereotypes about the LGBTQ+ Community.
