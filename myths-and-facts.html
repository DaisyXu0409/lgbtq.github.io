    <h1>Myths And Facts</h1>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Myth: Homosexuality is unnatural and against science</li>
        <li>Fact: Same-sex sexual behavior can be found in over 1,500 animal species. In fact, 
          scientists believe that same-sex relationships played an important role in evolution. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Myth: There are only two genders</li>
        <li>Fact: Many people mistakenly mixed up biological sex with gender. Many people do identified with their biological sex,
          but they’re two different things. Biological sex is the sex you are assigned at birth, commonly Male (XY) and Female (XX), 
          along with (at least 4) other biological sexes include X, XXY, XYY, etc. Gender, differ from biological sex,  is a social construction, 
          which varies across different cultures and over time. Some examples of different gender categories include the Berdache in North America, 
          the fa’afafine in the Pacific, and the kathoey in Thailand.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Myth:Being LGBTQ+ is a choice</li>
        <li>Fact:Homosexual/transgender cannot choose their sexual orientation/gender identity, 
          just like how heterosexual/cisgender people cannot choose to be gay or transgender. 
          Many LGBTQ+ people have experienced gender dysphoria/attractions towards the same sex from an early age (as early as 5 to 12 years old), which 
          then evolved during their adolescent or adult years.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Myth: Being LGBTQ+ is a mental illness</li>
        <li>Fact: On May 17, 1990, the World Health Organization (WHO) declassified Homosexuality as a mental disorder. 
          Roughly 29 years later on May 25, 2019, WHO removed ‘gender identity disorder’ from its global manual of diagnoses. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Myth: Most child predators are gay</li>
        <li>Fact: Over 90% of child molestations are caused by heterosexual men, and a child is over 100 times more likely to be sexually molested 
          by a heterosexual relative than by a homosexual. </li>
    </ul>
     <ul>
        <li>Myth: “Transage” exists and is part of the LGBTQ+ Community</li>
        <li>There is no scientific proof that “transage” or “age-fluid” actually exists. “Transage” or “age-fluid” comes off as
          an excuse for pedophiles to approach kids. Therefore (though they claim to be,) they’re not a part of the LGBTQ+ Community.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Myth: All masculine women are lesbians and all feminine men are gay</li>
        <li>Fact: A person’s dressing style cannot define their sexuality. You can be a lesbian who dressed feminine, 
          a gay man dressing masculinely, and vice versa. </li>
    </ul>
